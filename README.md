# LegalLens AI â€” Backend

This is the backend service for **LegalLens AI**, a contract clause analysis platform that uses transformer-based NLP models to detect and classify legal risks. This backend powers the API endpoints that receive contract text, run inference using a fine-tuned LegalBERT model, and return clause-level classifications.
